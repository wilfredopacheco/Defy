Defy
====

Defy is a JavaScript framework used to create single page applications hosted on Microsoft SharePoint (2010-2013) site collections. This version is a stripped implementation, isolating the core of the framework which takes advantage of Google's V8 engine. This template provides a starting point for developing a single page application on SharePoint, and defines the suggested directory structure for the framework. Defy creates a firm foundation to help escape customizing views using SharePoint's webpart implementation, and take full control of any project hosted on a site collection.

## Before You Begin  
This framework requires a Microsoft SharePoint site collection.

## Getting Started  
To begin, visit the site assets folder for the site collection (example: https://{site_url}/SiteAssets). Create a folder called "App" under the SiteAssets folder, and copy the contents of this framework. To load the application copy and pasting the following uniform resource locator (URL) into the web browser (example: https://{site_url}/SiteAssets/App/app.aspx).
